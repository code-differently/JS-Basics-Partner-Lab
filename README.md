# JS Basics Partner Lab

## Description
You will pair program with a partner to complete this assignemnt. One partner, the driver, should share their screen and be the one typing. The other partner, the observer, should review each line of code. Both partners should be cooperating when solving problems. When an objective has been met, the driver should push the code to the GitHub account, the observer should pull the changes, and the two partners switch roles. 

*Note: Use const to hold any values that should not change*

*Note: Use a switch where it makes sense*

## Problems
1. Ask the user for two numbers, divide the first by the second, and display the result
2. Ask the user to enter a number. Display the following:
   * `Fizz` if the number is divisble by three
   * `Buzz` if the number is divisable by five
   * `FizzBuzz` if the number is divisable by both
3. Generate a number between 1-10. Ask the user to guess the number and display if the user guessed correctly or not.
4. Generate two random numbers, ask the user to calculate the sum of the numbers, and display if they got it right or not.
5. Ask the user for a radius and calulate and display the area of a circle with that radius. If the user enters a negative number, provide them with a warning message and do not calculate the answer.
6. Ask the user for their weight and height and calculate their BMI. Display both the number value and the range they fall in. Example: `BMI: 22.5 Healthy`
7. Ask the user for a number and display a day of the week 

    Input: `0`
    Output: `Sunday`

    Input: `6`
    Output: `Saturday`

    Input: `8`
    Output: `Monday`

8. Create logic that mimics a coin flip (produces heads or tails randomly). Ask the user to guess what the coin flip was and display if they were correct or not.
9. Create a Rock, Paper, Scissors game. The computer should generate a random move and ask the user for their move. The computer should display who won. 

Happy Hacking!
